        Capability URLs grant access to a resource to anyone who has the URL. There are times when this is useful, for example one-shot password reset URLs, but overuse can be problematic as URLs cannot generally be kept secret. This document provides some good practices for web developers who wish to incorporate capability URLs into their applications.

        This is an unofficial draft and work in progress. It has no official standing and is currently only a sketch of an eventual Working Draft.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    	<p>There are two broad methods of controlling access to information that is published on the web:</p>
    	<ol>
    		<li> the server can have access control measures that require people accessing the content to provide the correct token(s) (such as a password) before the content is accessible</li>
    		<li> the information can be published at an obscure or unguessable URL, and links to it only provided to people who have permission to access it</li>
    	</ol>
    	<p>The URLs used in the second method are known as "capability URLs": an agent who possesses the URL is given the capability to access the information.</p>    	
    	<p>This document describes:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>cases where capability URLs are used on the web today</li>
    		<li>advantages and disadvantages of using capability URLs to control access to content</li>
    		<li>design considerations when creating websites that use capability URLs</li>
    		<li>areas of technical development to support the use of capability URLs</li>
    	</ul>
    </section>
  	<section id="examples">
    	<h2>Example Capability URLs</h2>
      <p>
        Capability URLs are in widespread usage. This section contains examples from the web where capability URLs are used.
      </p>
  		<section>
  			<h2>Password Resets</h2>
  			<p>
  				When a user forgets their password to access a site, the site cannot simply tell them what their password is as this would require the site to store and transmit their password as plain text, which is extremely insecure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pattern that is usually used instead is that the user is sent an email that contains a link that provides the user who has received that link with enough permissions to reset their password. This example is from Dropbox:
  			</p>
  			<pre class="example">
  				Your Dropbox password recently expired. You can reset it <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/l/Q8eJH22ft0ckDJDeff1Do10/password_reset">here</a>.
  			</pre>
  			<p>In this case the capability URL is <code>https://www.dropbox.com/l/Q8eJH22ft0ckDJDeff1Do10/password_reset</code>. Anyone accessing this link is able to change the password for the user with whom the capability URL is associated.</p>
  		</section>

  			<h2>Second Life</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Within the Second Life API, user agents aren't required to provide credentials with each action that they wish to take. Instead, they submit a single form with a username and password and the response contains a set of capability URLs for different capabilities. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
&lt;llsd>
  &lt;map>
    &lt;key>create_user&lt;/key>
    &lt;string>https://cap.secondlife.com/cap/0/35ff3b8c-a30d-4d18-b29a-e3f7f6c79cb6&lt;/string>
 
    &lt;key>check_name&lt;/key>
    &lt;string>https://cap.secondlife.com/cap/0/6e528ba1-a8b0-4f6b-8b56-362ee6f5cef8&lt;/string>
 
    &lt;key>get_last_names&lt;/key>
    &lt;string>https://cap.secondlife.com/cap/0/be4e4d2e-c00a-46cd-bb8d-d17cb8e92c9b&lt;/string>
 
    &lt;key>get_error_codes&lt;/key>
    &lt;string>https://cap.secondlife.com/cap/0/e75f81a5-b7da-4480-8f95-b1cf9d2d680f&lt;/string>
  &lt;/map>
&lt;/llsd>
        </pre>
  			<p>
  				The documentation provides two guidelines for using these capability URLs:
  			</p>
        <figure>
    			<blockquote cite="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Registration_API#Using_capability_URLs">
            <ul>
              <li>Do not hard-code your capabilities URLs. Either code your capabilities URLs as constants, or better yet, obtain them at run-time. Capability URLs will expire eventually, so fresh ones are always better.</li>
              <li>Keep your capability URLs secret! The capabilities granted to you are only meant for you. A capability URL is sensitive much like a password. Moreover, Linden Lab tracks the use of each capability.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Google Calendar</h2>
        <p>
          Google Calendar provides Private Addresses for XML and iCalendar formats of a calendar. These can be used by anyone within a feed reader or a calendar programme to provide access to the calendar, but users are warned "Your calendar's Private Address was designed for your use only, so be sure not to share this address with others." (from <a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37106?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1672529">About the 'Private Address'</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The help associated with Private Addresses similarly warns against sharing the URLs with others:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="gcal.png" alt="Help box reading 'Your calendar's Private Address is designed for your use only. All of your calendar information is available via your private links, so don't share this address with others. To change your Private Address and disable any previous access, click the Reset Private URLs link.'" />

  			<h2>Github Gists</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub Gists support sharing and discussing versioned code and other files with other people. These can be created anonymously, and can be kept private. Access to private Gists is provided simply through sharing the URL for the Gist.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="gist.png" alt="Gist page with a pop-up explaining 'Secret gists are hidden from search engines but visible to anyone you give the URL.'" />

  			<h2>Doodle polls</h2>
        <p>
          Doodle enables users to create polls that can be accessed through URLs without users logging in. The URLs are provided to the administrator of the poll within the browser and through email. For example:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="doodle.png" alt="Doodle page providing URLs with a Participation link saying 'Send this link to anyone you wish to invite.' and an Administration link saying 'Access this link to change, close or delete this poll.'" />

  		<h2>Reasons to Use Capabilty URLs</h2>
  		
      <p>There are three rationales for using capability URLs evident in the examples described above.</p>

  		<section>
  			<h3>No Login Required</h3>
        <p>
          A capability URL enables a user to access a service without having a login or password on that service. There are three situations where that is a particular advantage:
        </p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>users who can't remember login details</li>
  				<li>users who don't want to create accounts</li>
  				<li>developers who don't want to support accounts</li>
  			</ul>
        <section>
          <h4>Forgotten Passwords</h4>
          <p>
            Users frequently forget their passwords, especially when their form is restricted based on length or types of characters that they contain. Sending a URL to users who forget their passwords is preferable to sending a password because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>sending a password would require the website to send (and possibly store) the password in plain text, which is a bad security practice</li>
            <li>the capability URL can be disabled after it has been accessed, which means that even if the email or URL is shared later on, it doesn't provide ongoing access to the account</li>
            <li>the capability URL can resolve to a page that forces the user to reset their password; if users were simply presented with a password or granted access to the entire system with the URL then they might not remember to reset their password</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Low Friction Accounts</h4>
          <p>
            There are a proliferation of web-based services which provide for user accounts, to help record user preferences and history. Creating another user account can become a high burden for users, particularly when they don't expect to use the account very frequently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web-based applications that do not require user information in order to function may enable users to access the service without creating an account, or only prompt the user to create an account after they have used the service for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using capability URLs is beneficial to the more regular users of a web-based application because it enables them to collaborate with other people who are not regular users of the service. Regular users can create a resource and share a URL for that resource with their potential collaborators through another route (eg through email).
          </p>
          <p>
            Capability URLs that are used to facilitate collaboration without requiring accounts are generally controlled by a regular user, who might wish to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>create different capability URLs for different people or groups that they wish to collaborate with</li>
            <li>create different capability URLs for different types of action that they wish to permit on a resource (eg editing or commenting or viewing)</li>
            <li>be able to revoke permissions for given capability URLs if they learn they have been shared outside the intended group</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Websites without Accounts</h4>
          <p>
            Account management is seldom the main goal of a web-based application. Although it can be relatively easy for developers to plug in account management, there is an overhead involved: it can raise security concerns, and has legal implications because it  involves storing personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some applications there is no risk of someone else deleting important work belonging to another user. This might be because the web application is not used to do important work. Or it might be that the application does not support destructive acts.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these cases, it may be that the developer of a web application chooses to use capability URLs rather than supporting user accounts, letting them focus development on the main purpose of the application rather than account management.
          </p>
        </section>
  		</section>
  		
  		<section>
  			<h3>Easy Onward Sharing</h3>
        <p>
          A second set of reasons for supporting capability URLs is that it enables those with whom access is originally shared to continue to share that access with their own network.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if a user is trying to arrange a meeting between organisations, they might not know all the people who should attend the meeting from other organisations. Under a normal account-based method, the user would typically have to gather the information about who should attend the meeting before granting each of those individuals access to the system. With a capability URL, they only have to share the URL with a representative from each organisation, and trust that representative to pass on the URL to whichever colleagues need to take part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capability URLs can thus enable permissions to flow through networks more easily than they can with an account-based system.
        </p>
  		</section>
  		
  		<section>
  			<h3>Easy Client API</h3>
        <p>
          Authentication can be burdensome in HTTP APIs because HTTP is a stateless protocol and requires authentication tokens to be passed and processed on each transaction. This takes up both bandwidth and processing power, which can be a significant overhead for frequent, small, messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capability URLs can be used instead. Clients:
        </p>
  			<ol>
  				<li>perform authentication as normal</li>
  				<li>request a list of capability URLs to use for the rest of the session</li>
  				<li>use those URLs without authentication</li>
  			</ol>
        <p>
          This removes the authentication cost on each transaction while keeping the exchanges fairly secure.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          There are larger issues here about using HTTP for frequent, small, messages. Arguably, HTTP isn't an appropriate protocol in these circumstances, or other workarounds such as long polling or pipelined requests would work better.
        </p>
  		</section>
  	</section>
  	
  	<section id="disadvantages">
  		<h2>Potential Issues</h2>
      <p>
        There are disadvantages to using capability URLs arising from the fact that the URLs were not originally designed to be used in this way.
      </p>
  		<section>
  			<h3>Risk of Exposure</h3>
  			<p>
          In general, applications that use URLs are not designed to treat them as sensitive information. URLs appear within URL bars, from which they can be copied easily. They appear within application logs, such as within web servers and in browser history.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more subtle routes for exposure too. If a link to another site is followed on a page accessed through a capability URL, that site may be notified of the capability URL through the <code>Referer</code> HTTP header. Third party scripts within a page accessed through a capability URL can access that URL and potentially record it elsewhere.
        </p>
  		</section>
  		
  		<section>
  			<h3>Handling Compromises</h3>
        <p>
          If a capability URL does leak out to unwanted recipients, the person who originally granted access through that URL needs to be able to revoke it. This is exactly the same as needs to happen in normal account-driven access control. However, capability URLs tend to be designed to be the same for everyone who has the given capability, and therefore revoking the capability URL has an impact on all those who had it. Conversely, in account-based access control it tends to be possible to target the withdrawal of rights on a single user.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be possible to design systems that use capability URLs in a more targetted way: that enable users to generate multiple URLs for the same capability and to pass those on to different people. This would enable targetted revocation of access rights when a particular URL is compromised.
        </p>
  		</section>
  		
  		<section>
  			<h2>Web Architecture</h2>
  			<p>
          Capability URLs encode a combination of a resource and access privileges for that resource. This leads to separate URLs being used to refer to the same resource (but with different permissions about what can be done with it). For example, Google Calendar provides different URLs for the same iCalendar representation of a calendar for public and private use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using multiple URLs for the same resource runs contrary to good practice:
        </p>
        <figure>
    			<blockquote>
    				<strong>Good practice: Avoiding URI aliases</strong>
    				<br />
    				A URI owner SHOULD NOT associate arbitrarily different URIs with the same resource.
    			</blockquote>
          <figcaption><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#avoid-uri-aliases">Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          However, the main reason for avoiding URI aliases is based on sharing of the URI: it is better for everyone linking to, or talking about, the same resource to refer to it with the same URL, as this creates a more coherent network. Unlike normal URLs, capability URLs are oriented around only limited sharing. In these circumstances, having multiple aliases is not an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          What may need to be considered, however, is how to transition from providing access to a resource through capability URLs and taking it public, using a normal URL. This is discussed further in <a href="#canonical-urls" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
  		</section>
  		
  		<section>
  			<h2>Beyond the Single Page</h2>
  			<p>
          All the examples of capability URLs described in <a class="sectionRef" href="#examples"></a> are self-contained: once a user has accessed a page through a capability URL, they are able to do all they need to do within that page. Capability URLs are less easy to use in applications that require the user to access multiple pages, because each of those pages must be accessed through a (different) capability URL.
